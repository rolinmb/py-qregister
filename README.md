Referencing my py-qubits repo to try and recreate the functionality of a quantum register.

Some thoughs/TODO:

    * IDK if I am validating a quantum register correctly. I couldn't find an exact equation like the method used to validate an inidividual qudit;
    the implementation I have is a result of working with ChatGPT. I am assuming a valid qudit must have its individual measurement
    state probabilities sum to 1 (i.e. the sum of complex modulus for each complex number describing a qudit must sum to 1). This still allows
    for encoded states that may not ever be observable (i.e. have complex modulus/probability of 0).

    * Shoutout ThePrimeagen and Charles Babbage for the turing machine. Baciscally the depends on people monitoring if we stay on the longest non-turing complete quantum computer simpulation with humanity in tactv (i.e. the simulation that never ends with humanity remaining). This requires a massively distributed computational task network that atims be simulating our local region of the univers (idk how you would even calculate that distance in lightyears)
    
    * IDK how to visualize all the states and ther probabilities (permutations may need a revisit smh)
