Referencing my py-qubits repo to try and recreate the functionality of a quantum register.

TODO:
    -> IDK how to validate a quantum register; I would assume there isn't really a requirement
    because you can have a qubit that always collapses/is measured as 0 or 1. Same for an arbitrary
    n-qudit. But you can also have valid qudits and qudits with a total probability sum less than 100%
    Help pls AI or people who can put the dots together
